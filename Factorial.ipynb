    "The ideal factorial algorithm uses the input n as the factorial, and then takes the value n and decrements it, as long as it is above 1, and multiplies the value of n by the decremented values to 1, where then the factorial reuslt is found. If 0 is input, then the algorithm will return the factorial result at 1."

    "1) The factorial program is multplying everything by 0 in the last iteration which causes the computation for the factorial to be incorrect. In the last loop, n=1, which satifies the loop conditions, but then it is decremented to 0, and proceeds to multiply itself by the factorial.\n",
